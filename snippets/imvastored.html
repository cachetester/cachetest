Implicit validation of responses without freshness lifetime
This Table describes whether web caching systems perform an implicit validation. Caches which proactively initiate a validation process if they notices that clients recurrently execute equivalent requests are considered to support implicit validation. Such a validation is done by transforming the clients' requests to conditional requests containing the <code>If-None-Match</code> or <code>If-Modified-Since</code> header field. That is, the cache receives a request from the client which does not contain any conditions. The cache owns a suitable stored response which can be reused for satisfy the client's request. This cached response has neither any explicit caching requirements nor any explicit freshness lifetime definitions. The only cache-related information of this response is a validation token, i.e. the <code>ETag</code>, <code>Last-Modified</code> or <code>Date</code> header. Instead of recycling this response directly, the intermediary proactively converts the client's request into conditional request including one of the validation tokens and send it to the server. Such a behavior is considered as implicit, since the cache performs a validation by it's own choice. The client and server do not tell the cache to do this. In contrast, an explicit validation means that the origin server forces the cache to perform an validation before reusing the stored response. The symbol [ok] shows that implicit validation is performed for requests containing an validation token without a freshness lifetime definition. Test results which depicts that a cache does not transform the client's request in to a conditional request meaning that the cache retrieves the full response with body are marked with [fail]. The ([ok]) indicates that the cache proactively converts a client's requests into conditional requests but the web caching systems does something which is in not in accordance with the caching policies of the RFC 7234.More details are described at the info icon.
