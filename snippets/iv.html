Invalidation
The invalidation of freshness defines an action which prohibits the reuse of response even though its freshness lifetime is not expired. The RFC 7234 forces caches to invalidate a response freshness if the result of a request to an equivalent URI, embodying an unsafe HTTP method including PUT, POST, PATCH and DELETE, is not a error response. The standard defines the status code classes 4xx and 5xx as error response. This Table depicts if an invalidation is initiated after a successful update or creation requests. The symbol [ok] shows that an invalidation is performed while [fail] declares that web caching systems still return a stored content even the resource has been deleted or updated.
