Invalidation
The invalidation of freshness defines an action which prohibits the reuse of a certain response even though its freshness lifetime is not expired. The RFC 7234 forces caches to invalidate the response's freshness if the result of a request to an equivalent URI, embodying an unsafe HTTP method is not a error response. Unsafe methods are PUT, DELETE, POST and PATCH.
The standard defines the status code classes 4xx and 5xx as error response. This table depicts if an invalidation is initiated after a successful requests containing an unsafe HTTP method. The symbol [ok] shows that an invalidation is performed while [fail] declares that web caching systems still return a stored content even the state of a resource has been changed.
