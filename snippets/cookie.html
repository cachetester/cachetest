Caching responses with Set-Cookie header
The <code>Set-Cookie</code> header represents a vital meta information for transferring session ids to the client. With session ids included in the <code>Cookie</code> request header, users can be identified and authenticated by web applications. Hence, the disclosure of a <code>Set-Cookie</code> header field to an attacker induces severe consequences. With this threat in mind, we analyze the web caching systems whether they store responses including the <code>Set-Cookie</code> header. The symbol [ok] indicates that a response with a <code>Set-Cookie</code> header field is stored and reused. The info icon shows if the web caching removes the <code>Set-Cookie</code> header when storing and reusing the response.
