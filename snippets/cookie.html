Caching responses with Set-Cookie header
The <code>Set-Cookie</code> header represents a vital meta information for transferring a session id to the client. With this session id included in the <code>Cookie</code> header field of the requests, users can be identified and authenticated by web applications. Hence, the disclosure of a <code>Set-Cookie</code> header field to an attacker induces severe consequences. With this threat in mind, we analyze the web caching systems whether they store responses including a <code>Set-Cookie</code> header field. The symbol [ok] indicates that a response with a <code>Set-Cookie</code> header field is stored. The info icon below show if the web caching removes the <code>Set-Cookie</code> header when storing and reusing the response.
