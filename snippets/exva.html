Explicit validation of responses without freshness lifetime
The results in this table depict if the caches perform a freshness validation for equivalent requests when origin server force them to do it with the control directive <code>no-cache</code>. A freshness validation, also known as conditional request, is performed based on validation tokens included in the stored response. RFC 7234 defines two types of validation tokens: (1) an opaque entity tag represented by the <code>ETag</code> header field and (2) a time-variant parameter that can be retrieved form the <code>Date</code> or <code>Last-Modified</code> header. If a response does not comprise the <code>ETag</code>, <code>Last-Modified</code> or <code>Date</code> header, a conditional request may contain a self-defined timestamp derived from a cache-internal clock. A freshness validation request intending to verify with an opaque token must contain the <code>If-None-Match</code> header comprising one or multiple entity tags. Freshness validation requests based on a time-variant token require to append the <code>If-Modified-Since</code> header including either a self-defined timestamp or the timestamp value of the <code>Date</code> or <code>Last-Modified</code> header. A successful freshness validation requests results in a response with a <code>304 Not Modified</code> status code. The symbol [ok] indicates that the cache transform equivalent requests into conditional requests. The symbol [fail] indicates that a equivalent request is not transformed into conditional requests, meaning that the cache send a request without any condition to retrieve the full response with body. If caches perform an explicit conditional request but does something wrong after the validation, we mark this with ([ok]). More details on the issues can be see at the info icon.
