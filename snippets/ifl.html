Implicit Freshness Lifetime
If no <code>Expires</code> and<code> Cache-Control</code> header fields with <code>max-age</code> or <code>s-maxage</code> are available, the web caching standard allows a cache to calculate a implicit freshness lifetime when certain precondition a given. One condition is suitable status code such as <code>200 Ok</code>. Such a freshness lifetime can be self-defined a value by using heuristics or a predefined fixed expiration time. The other option for specifying an implicit freshness lifetime is to derive expiration time from the <code>Last-Modified</code> or <code>Date</code> header. Origin servers which permit caches to calculate an implicit freshness lifetime for contents not fulfilling the preconditions in terms of an unsuitable status code such as <code>201 Created</code>, can include the directive <code>public</code> in the <code>Cache-Control</code> header. Note that, defining an implicit freshness lifetime is not mandatory. Cache can decide by themselves to store responses implicitly. This Table shows if the web caching systems store responses implicitly <strong>by default</strong>. This means we only configure the web caching systems to forward requests to our cache test server. The goal is to analyze if the caches store responses even when no freshness lifetime control directives of responses are set. The [ok] symbol denotes that an implicit freshness lifetime is calculated as well as the stored response is reused for equivalent requests. The [fail] symbol indicates that the response is not reused.
