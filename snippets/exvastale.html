Explicit validation of stale responses
This Table depicts whether the web caching systems support the <code>must-revalidate</code>, <code>proxy-revalidate</code> and <code>s-maxage</code> control directives. If one of these control directive is set, the RFC 7234 does not allow to return stale responses and requires the cache to validate expired stored responses. If server returns a <code>304 Not Modified</code> status code indicating that the response has not changed, then the cache can reuse the stored response but must update the header with header elements of the server's response. If the resource has been modified, a server returns a full response with body. The cache must forward this new response to the client. If the server does not respond or replies with error code, the cache is not allowed to reuse a stale response and must return with the error code <code>504 Gateway Time-out</code>. The symbol [ok] denotes that the caches follow the instructions of the web caching standard. Test results showing that the caches either do not perform a conditional request or reuse a stale response even it is prohibited are marked with [fail]. Moreover, the info icon describes more details on the test results.
