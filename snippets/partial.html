Partial content
Beside ensuring scalability and performance, caching systems may include other services. The retrieving of a partial content of stored responses is, e.g., another core topic of RFC 7234 and can be used for optimizing the performance likewise. If the transfer of a response is interrupted for some reasons and a client has not received the whole content, it may perform a range request retrieving only the missing bytes of the response instead of invoking the whole transmission again ultimately decreasing the amount of data to be transferred. This Table shows which cache supports the retrieval of partial content.
