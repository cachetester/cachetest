Explicit freshness lifetime
This Table shows if the proxy caches honor the freshness lifetime definition of the control directives, <code>max-age</code>, <code>s-maxage</code> and the <code>Expires</code> header. The <code>max-age</code> and <code>s-maxage</code> control directives defines the relative freshness lifetime in seconds. The only difference between <code>max-age</code> and <code>s-maxage</code> is that <code>s-maxage</code> only applies for shared caches. The <code>max-age</code> parameter is dedicated for all caches, i.e. private and shared caches. The symbol [ok] indicates that this control directive or header field is supported properly. The disobey of freshness lifetime definitions is shown by the symbol [fail]. Also, the Table depicts if the proxy caches comply with the order of priority. The <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7234#section-5.3">RFC 7234</a> requires to prefer <code>max-age</code> when the <code>max-age</code> control directive and the <code>Expires</code> header are present simultaneously. If <code>max-age</code> and <code>s-maxage</code> are set at the same time, a shared cache must consider <code>s-maxage</code> while a private cache must take account of <code>max-age</code>. The symbol [ok] depicts also the compliance with  the order of priority while [fail] indicates a non-conformance. Tests results which are non-determinable are declared with [x].
