Implicit validation of stale responses
This table shows the test results analyzing whether caches trigger an implicit conditional request to validate the freshness of an expired response. To test implicit validation we return responses containing a validation token, i.e. the <code>ETag</code>, <code>Date</code> or <code>Last-Modified</code> header and freshness lifetime definition. To analyze if the caches send a implicit conditional request for stale responses, we use the <code>-p</code> parameter to wait until the freshness lifetime is expired. After that we send an equivalent request and evaluate the returned response from the cache. Caches which do perform an implicit validation request are marked with [ok]. Web caching systems which do not initiate conditional request and forward the client's request to retrieve the a new response with body are denoted with [fail]. The symbol ([ok]) indicates that implicit validation of stale responses is only partially performed properly. More details on the issues can be see at the info icon.
