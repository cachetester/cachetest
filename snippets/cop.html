Client-originated policies
Clients can define cache-related requirements for responses as well. To do so they can use the control directives <code>max-age</code>, <code>max-stale</code>, <code>no-store</code>, <code>min-fresh</code>, <code>only-if-cached</code> and <code>no-cache</code>. These parameters must be included in the <code>Cache-Control</code> header. <code>max-age</code>, <code>no-store</code> and <code>no-cache</code> has same semantic meaning as the counterpart control directives for the response. With <code>max-stale</code> clients declare to accept a response with a maximum staleness. The <code>min-fresh</code> parameter requires that the returned response must still be fresh for at least the specified seconds. Client sending <code>only-if-cached</code> are only willing to receive a stored response. If the cache does not have a suitable cached response, the web caching system must return a <code>504 Gateway Time-out</code> status code. The [ok] indicates that the caches are in conformance with the web caching standard. The [fail] symbol declares that the client-side control directive is ignored by the cache.
