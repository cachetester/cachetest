Delivering stale responses
The RFC 7234 allows to a cache to return stale responses for certain cases if the origin server is not available or send an error code. When a stale response is returned, a cache must append the <code>Warning</code> header informing the client about the expired response. This table evaluates if caches satisfy recurring requests when the origin server is not available or returns an error message. The symbol [ok] implies that a stale response is reused and [fail] illustrates that a stale response is not returned.
