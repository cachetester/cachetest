  Caching has been established as a vital mechanism for providing high scalability in modern distributed software systems. In the web, the storage and reuse of frequently asked responses represent the formula of success ever since. Therefore, the IETF has published a web caching standard, the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7234" target="_blank">RFC 7234</a>, providing policies and control directives for all kinds of web caching systems. 
  The Figure below depicts the different types of web caching systems classified by location and resource access policy. You can see that web caching systems can occur in various location on the path between client and server.

  This website provides further information on the large-scale explorative study of web caching. This study aims to analyze the current state of web caching where we have analyzed 6 <a href="?cache=proxycaches">proxy caches</a> and the <a href="?cache=cdns">Amazon Cloud Front CDN</a> with our cache testing tool and cache test suite.
