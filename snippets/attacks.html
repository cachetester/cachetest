Further security issues
Security consideration on web caching attacks are described in RFC 7230 at <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-9" target="_blank">Section 9</a>. This table shows if the web caching systems comply with security requirements defined in web caching standard. The analysis focus on two attacks: 

<ol>
	<li><a href="http://projects.webappsec.org/w/page/13246928/HTTP%20Request%20Smuggling" target="_blank">HTTP request smuggling</a> which results from parsing two Content-Length header, even though it is prohibited</li>
	<li>
		<a href="https://omergil.blogspot.de/2017/02/web-cache-deception-attack.html" target="_blank">Web deception attack</a> that exploits the misbehavior that implicit freshness lifetime policies are preferred over explicit caching requirements.
	</li>
</ol>

The symbol [ok] indicates that the web caching systems honor the security requirements and [fail] implies a dishonor.
