Cache key adaption
The default cache key according to the RFC 7234 is the HTTP method and URL. The HTTP caching standards allows to add further request header fields by using the <code>Vary</code> header (e.g <code>Vary: Accept, Accept-Language</code>). The Table belows shows whether the web caching systems support extending the cache key via the <code>Vary</code> header. Accordingly, [ok] indicates that the Vary field is supported and [fail] means it is not considered.
